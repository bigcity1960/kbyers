Create a new package named new_pkg.

This directory should have two modules mod1.py and mod2.py.

Each module should have a function that prints a out a message.

Create a __init__.py for the package.

In the __init__.py, import your two functions from mod1 and mod2.

Create a separate program that imports your pkg and executes the two functions.

Verify that the two messages are printed out.
