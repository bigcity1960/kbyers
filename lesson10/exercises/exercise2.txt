Create a module named my_code.py in the my_pkg that you created in exercise1.

my_lib should use the __name__ technique to separate executable code from importable code.

In the executable section just print "hello world"

In the importable section, create a function that does X

Directly execute your program and make sure that the "hello world" prints.

Import your function in a separate python program and make sure that works.
